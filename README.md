# things-i-learnt-in-lockdown
A collection of random bits and bobs I've been tinkering with in 2020. My only real aim here is to learn stuff so most of the code will remain unfinished and undocumented!

Trying to learn C by implimenting RK4 for a restricted three body system (moonshot). Perhaps I should have picked something more straightforward for my second program after hello world... I hadn't yet learnt enough to know if my issues were with the code or with the approach to the problem.

A better place to pickup some C is following a tutorial on how to make a console text editor (kilo). Later on I started doing some of the tutorials from learn-C.org e.g. linked lists.

I also was using some python to cleanup and categorise my bank statements (I was really bored by this point in lockdown). Initially this was just to estimate living costs at uni, but it occured to me the labelled data could be used for an ML project in the future...

I also wanted to start to learn pandas so tried to impliment a student loan repayment calculator I'd previously made in excel. I also faffed with Jupyter ipython widgets for a while to make some interactive plots.
